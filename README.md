    <h2>„ÄãDescription</h2>
  </summary>

  <h3><strong>General</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 representative for each section</li>
    <li>The contest will be held on <strong>April 14, 2023</strong> in the Computer Laboratory on the 3rd floor of the University of Caloocan City Congressional Campus. Participants should meet at <strong>10:00 AM</strong> for a brief introductory talk. The event proper will begin at <em>10:30 AM</em> and end at <em>3:00 PM</em>.</li>
    <li>Participants are required to present a current registration form.</li>
    <li>Participants cannot bring any notes or textbooks to the event room. Blank sheets of paper and pencils will be allowed.</li>
    <li>MIS Student Assistants will be assigned to observe participants throughout the event and report any problems and/or violations of the rules to the Event Committee.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Programming Environment</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The event will be composed of the stages with time allotment each:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Easy (30 minutes)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Average (45 minutes)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Hard (1 Hour)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Each participant will be allowed to use only a single computer and must write and test their programs on that machine, wholly within the event room.</li>
    <li>PC compatible computers running Windows 10 will be used. At the Event Committee's discretion, participants may be allowed to use their own computer in the event, provided that they notify the Event Committee in writing at least one week prior to the event, indicating the make and key features of their machine.</li>
    <li>Participants may write their programs in whichever language they prefer in the following:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>C</strong></li>
      <li><strong>C++</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Java</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <li>At the Event Committee's discretion, participants may be allowed to bring/use their own compiler (or interpreter) in the event provided that they notify the Event Committee in writing before the event and indicate the make, version number, and key features of their chosen compiler.</li>
    <li>Participants may not seek hints and/or ask for leads during the event. They may, however, submit questions about procedure and/or clarification, in writing, to the Event Committee who will ensure that all participants receive the same information as deemed necessary.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><strong>Evaluation of Participants' Programs</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All participants will be given the same set of problems to solve.</li>
    <li>Each problem will have a specified point value. The more difficult the problem, the more points a correct solution will receive.</li>
    <li>Programs will be tested by MIS Student Assistants (appointed by the Event Facilitator) by running them with a set of test inputs. The output for each test case will be marked as right or wrong using keys prepared before the event.</li>
    <li>A program will be considered wrong if it fails to work on one or more of the test cases.</li>
  </ul>

I am thrilled to have achieved first place in the C++ Programming Competition! The challenges were tough, but I enjoyed every minute of the competition, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to test my skills and push myself to new heights.

The competition had questions ranging from easy, average, to hard difficulty levels. I'm proud of myself for being able to solve all the questions with ease.
